# Job Watcher Playbook

Reference for maintaining this project and adding new company pipelines.

---

## What This System Does

Monitors job postings from multiple companies every 30 minutes via GitHub Actions. Filters for India-based .NET/C# software engineering roles. Sends Telegram + email alerts only for jobs not seen before. Each company has its own fetcher, run script, seen-jobs file, and config section — all isolated from each other.

---

## Filter Layers

**3 layers apply to every company. Wells Fargo has a 4th (opt-in only).**

**Layer 1 — Location**
- Job location must contain "India"
- Must not be Chennai, Tamil Nadu, Pune, Chandigarh, or Kochi (configured per company via `exclude_locations`)

**Layer 2 — Title**
- Title must match the software engineer family (`matching.title_family` in config)
- Title must not match `matching.exclude_terms` (no interns, managers, hardware, etc.)

**Layer 3 — Skills**
- Description must contain at least one **primary** .NET/C# skill (`.NET`, `C#`, `ASP.NET`, `Web API`, `SQL Server`, `T-SQL`, `Entity Framework`, `dotnet`) — Azure/Angular/TypeScript alone do not pass

**Layer 4 — Tech in title (Wells Fargo only — do not add to new companies by default)**
- Job title must explicitly contain a .NET/C# tech term (`require_tech_in_title` in config)
- Added because WF's generic "Senior Software Engineer" titles are mostly Java/Python roles
- Activated only in `run_wellsfargo.py` as a post-filter — not in `matcher.py`

Deduplication: jobs already in `seen_jobs_<company>.json` are never re-alerted (all companies).

## Architecture

```
config.yaml                    ← all config (search params + shared matching rules)
src/
  matcher.py                   ← shared filter engine (title family → exclude → skills)
  notifier.py                  ← Telegram + email alerts
  main.py                      ← Microsoft pipeline (uses fetcher.py)
  <company>_fetcher.py         ← data source: fetch_jobs() + fetch_job_description()
  run_<company>.py             ← pipeline entry point
seen_jobs_<company>.json       ← deduplication state
.github/workflows/watcher.yml  ← runs all pipelines in parallel
```

**matcher.py expects every fetcher to export exactly three things:**
```python
class RateLimitError(Exception): ...
def fetch_jobs(keyword, location, *, num, start, sort_by, timeout) -> list[dict]: ...
def fetch_job_description(application_url, timeout) -> tuple[str, str]: ...
```

Each job dict must have: `id`, `title`, `location`, `posting_date`, `application_url`.

---

## Filter Pipeline (All Companies)

```
fetch_jobs()
    └─ is_india_job()                  skip non-India silently
    └─ exclude_locations check         skip Chennai/Pune/Tamil Nadu silently
    └─ passes_exclude_check()          [exclude] tag in near-miss log
    └─ passes_title_family_check()     [title family] tag in near-miss log
        └─ fetch_job_description()
            └─ primary_skills check    [broad-only] / [react-only] / [skill] tags
```

**Layer 4 (Wells Fargo only — opt-in, never added by default):**
```
    └─ require_tech_in_title check     [title-tech] tag in near-miss log
```

Implemented in `run_wellsfargo.py` as a post-filter after `find_matching_jobs`. Not in `matcher.py`, not shared, not active for any other company.

## How to Add a New Company

> **Every company is different.** The steps below capture what worked across 6 past integrations. They are a starting point, not a checklist. Each new ATS will have its own quirks — different API shapes, bot protection, date formats, title conventions, or pagination schemes. Read what the new system actually does before reaching for a copy-paste from an existing fetcher. The goal is always accurate job alerts; the playbook is there to save time, not to constrain good judgment.

### Step 1 — Identify the ATS (10–20 min)

Open the careers page in a browser, search for a role, open DevTools → Network tab, look at XHR/fetch calls. Ask:

- **Does `requests.get/post` return job data?** → REST API approach (fast, like Optum/Wells Fargo)
- **Are all API responses empty or 403?** → Playwright needed (like Honeywell)
- **Is Chromium blocked?** → Use Firefox (Honeywell lesson)

Common ATS vendors and what to expect:

| ATS | Signal | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **Workday** | URL contains `wd1.myworkdayjobs.com` or apply button links there | `POST /wday/cxs/{code}/{tenant}/jobs` with JSON body; India WID from facets |
| **Phenom People** | URL contains `/en/sites/{Company}/jobs` | `POST /widgets` with `refNum` extracted from page HTML |
| **Oracle HCM CE** | URL contains `fa.ocs.oraclecloud.com` or `oraclecloud.com` | Playwright/Firefox — JS SPA, API blocked server-side |
| **iCIMS** | URL contains `icims.com` | REST API or HTML scraping |
| **Greenhouse** | URL contains `greenhouse.io` | Public REST API, well-documented |
| **Lever** | URL contains `lever.co` | Public REST API |
| **SAP SuccessFactors J2W** | URL contains `careers.<company>.com` with job list at `/go/...` and detail at `/job/.../{id}/`; "J2W" (Job-to-Work) branding | HTML scraping — `<tr class="data-row">` table rows; pagination via path `/go/.../{offset}/`; description in `<span class="jobdescription">`; date in `<meta itemprop="datePosted">` |
| **Taleo** | URL contains `taleo.net` | HTML scraping usually required |
| **Phenom People** | URL contains `phenompeople.com` CDN assets or `refNum` in page JS | `/widgets` API requires browser session — use sitemap.xml + JSON-LD scraping |

### Step 2 — Map the response structure

Find: job ID field, title field, location field, posting date field, application URL field. These vary per ATS — check the raw JSON/HTML before writing code.

Watch out for:
- Relative dates ("Posted 3 Days Ago") — need conversion to `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Abbreviated titles ("Engr" instead of "Engineer") — may need additions to `title_family` in config
- JavaScript-rendered descriptions — plain `requests` may return empty; need Playwright or a JSON detail API

### Step 3 — Create `src/<company>_fetcher.py`

Copy the closest existing fetcher as a starting point:
- REST JSON → copy `wellsfargo_fetcher.py`
- HTML scraping → copy `siemens_fetcher.py`
- Playwright needed → copy `honeywell_fetcher.py`

Must export:
```python
class RateLimitError(Exception): ...

def fetch_jobs(keyword, location, *, num=20, start=0, sort_by="date", timeout=20) -> list[dict]:
    # Returns: [{"id": ..., "title": ..., "location": ..., "posting_date": ..., "application_url": ...}]

def fetch_job_description(application_url, timeout=20) -> tuple[str, str]:
    # Returns: (description_text, posting_date_string)
```

Always include:
- Retry loop (3 attempts, exponential backoff)
- `RateLimitError` on 429 or persistent failure — matcher.py catches this and logs a warning instead of crashing
- Browser-like `User-Agent` header

### Step 4 — Create `src/run_<company>.py`

Copy `run_siemens.py` exactly. Change 4 things:
```python
import siemens_fetcher     →  import <company>_fetcher
"siemens_search"           →  "<company>_search"
seen_jobs_siemens.json     →  seen_jobs_<company>.json
source="Siemens"           →  source="<Company Name>"
```

Add at the top:
```python
if hasattr(sys.stdout, "reconfigure"):
    sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")
```

Wrap the `__main__` block in try/except so a crash doesn't break other pipelines running in parallel.

### Step 5 — Add to `config.yaml`

Add a new section before `notifications:`:
```yaml
<company>_search:
  max_listings: 200
  inter_page_delay: 0.2       # be polite; 0.1 for fast APIs
  keywords:
    - "software engineer"
    - "senior software engineer"
    - ".NET developer"
    - "C# developer"
    - "dot net"
    - "angular"
  locations:
    - "India"
  exclude_locations:
    - "Chennai"
    - "Tamil Nadu"
    - "Pune"
    - "Chandigarh"
  # DO NOT add require_tech_in_title unless explicitly asked
```

Check if the company's ATS uses server-side keyword filtering (Workday does) or ignores keywords (Siemens doesn't). If it ignores keywords, all keywords will return the same result set and deduplication will handle it.

### Step 6 — Update `.github/workflows/watcher.yml`

Two additions only:

**In the parallel run step** (add next `pidN`):
```yaml
python -u src/run_<company>.py & pid7=$!
...
wait $pid7 || fail=1
```

**In the save step:**
```bash
test -f seen_jobs_<company>.json && git add seen_jobs_<company>.json || true
```

If the company needs Playwright: Firefox is already installed and cached. No workflow changes needed for that.

### Step 7 — Create `seen_jobs_<company>.json`

```json
[]
```

Commit this file alongside everything else.

### Step 8 — Test locally, then push

```bash
py src/run_<company>.py
```

Verify:
- Non-zero jobs fetched with India locations
- Near-miss log shows `[title family]`, `[skill]`, `[broad-only]` tags firing correctly — no obvious false positives
- No Java/Python/cloud-native jobs slipping through as matches
- Pune/Kochi/Chandigarh/Chennai/Tamil Nadu not in any matched result's location
- Alert fires (or "not sent (no new matches)" if all already seen)

## Key Bugs We Hit (Don't Repeat These)

| Bug | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `[broad-only]` false positives | Azure/Angular appearing in non-.NET JDs | `primary_skills` hard filter — broad skills alone never pass |
| Honeywell fetching 0 jobs | Oracle HCM CE returns empty body to plain HTTP | Switched to Playwright/Firefox |
| Chromium `ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR` on Honeywell | Akamai TLS fingerprinting blocks headless Chromium | Use Firefox — confirmed working |
| Job titles empty (`inner_text()` = `""`) on Honeywell | KnockoutJS renders title in sibling element, not inside `<a>` | Follow `aria-labelledby` → `getElementById` → `.job-tile__title` |
| `_cache_filled` retry storm (Honeywell) | Flag set after the try-block, so every keyword retried on failure | Set `_cache_filled = True` before the try |
| "Software Engr II" filtered as `[title family]` | Honeywell abbreviates "Engineer" as "Engr" | Added `"software engr"` to global `title_family` in config |
| Descriptions only 16 chars (Honeywell) | `[class*='description']` matched a tiny label div | Added `len(t) > 100` guard before accepting matched element |
| Playwright workflow cached Chromium, ran Firefox | Copy-paste oversight | Cache key and install commands must both say `firefox` |
| Wells Fargo `fetch_job_description` returning empty | Workday job pages are JS SPAs — plain HTML has no content | Use JSON detail API: `GET /wday/cxs/wf/WellsFargoJobs{externalPath}` |
| Wells Fargo `limit=0` returns HTTP 400 | Workday rejects zero-result requests | Hardcode India WID discovered from a real search with `limit=1+` |
| `postedOn: "Posted Yesterday"` not parsed | `_parse_posted_on` only handled "X Days Ago" | Added explicit `"yesterday"` case |
| 92 matched Wells Fargo jobs (too many) | Description fetch was broken → matcher kept all as fallback | Fixed description → re-ran → 26; added title-tech filter → 2 |
| WTW India location facet (`300000000346515`) not filtering | Oracle HCM CE at `eedu.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com` ignores `selectedLocationsFacet` — returns Philippines job with India facet applied | Fetch globally (no facet); `is_india_job()` filters client-side — WTW's total job count is small enough (~70 per keyword) that this is fine |
| Morningstar Phenom `/widgets` API always returns `{"status":"failure"}` | Phenom People at `careers.morningstar.com` requires browser-side JS session state (PLAY_SESSION JWT + CSRF token) that plain HTTP cannot replicate | Use sitemap.xml (208 URLs) + JSON-LD on each page; filter India via `addressCountry`; cache all India jobs + descriptions in-module so subsequent keyword calls are free |
| Maersk `locationsText = "2 Locations"` bypasses India check | Workday shows "2 Locations" when a job is available in multiple sites; `is_india_job()` in matcher.py checks for "india" in location text, so these jobs were silently skipped | In `_fill_cache`, set `loc_text = "India"` when "india" is not in the location text — safe because we already pre-filtered with India WIDs |
| Maersk `careers.maersk.com` API not usable | Requires `Consumer-Key` header (extracted from frontend JS `api-keys.DfSBqKQY.js`) and only returns 150 India jobs — all non-technical (CSM, Finance, Operations) — none are software engineering roles | Use Workday directly: `maersk.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/maersk/Maersk_Careers/jobs` with India location WIDs in `appliedFacets.locations` |
| Nomura `?startRow=N` doesn't paginate | SuccessFactors J2W India portal uses path-based pagination, not query-string. `?startRow=100` returns the same 100 jobs as `?startRow=0` | Use path segments: `/9050900/100/` for page 2, `/9050900/200/` for page 3. Correct URLs discovered from the `<a class="paginationItemFirst">` links in the HTML |
| Citi facet key is `Country_and_Jurisdiction` not `locationCountry` | Citi's Workday tenant uses a non-standard facet key — sending `locationCountry` is silently ignored | Use `Country_and_Jurisdiction` as the facet key; India WID `c4f78be1a8f14da0ab49ce1162348a5e` |
| BNY Mellon is Oracle HCM CE not Workday | `bnymellon.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com` returned HTTP 422 for all site/tenant combos | Use Oracle HCM CE at `eofe.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com`, site `BNY-Careers`; same REST pattern as Chubb/Amex |
| Deutsche Bank country/keyword filter ignored server-side | Beesite API (`api-deutschebank.beesite.de/search/`) accepts but silently ignores `PositionCountry` and keyword criteria — always returns the full global pool | Cache all ~1808 jobs on first call, filter India by `CountryCode==IN` client-side; descriptions fetched from Workday CXS at `db.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com` |
| Barclays appears to use TalentBrew but is actually Workday | `search.jobs.barclays` loads TalentBrew JS as a frontend skin; apply links go to `barclays.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com` | Probe the underlying XHR requests; use Workday CXS directly with 11 India city WIDs |
| UBS is IBM BrassRing not Workday | All Workday probes (`ubs.wd1/wd3/wd5.myworkdayjobs.com`) returned 422 | Use IBM BrassRing at `jobs.ubs.com/TgNewUI/Search/Ajax/PowerSearchJobs`; extract CSRF token (`__RequestVerificationToken`) from page HTML and pass as `RFT` header |
| UBS pagination wraps around | `TotalJobsCount` is always 0; incrementing `PageNumber` eventually cycles back to the first page | Stop pagination when a page yields zero new job IDs |
| Accenture `total` field is 0 on paginated requests | Workday `total` field returns 0 for offset > 0 even when jobs are returned | Use empty `jobPostings` array as the termination signal, not `total` |
| Infosys `additionalResponsibility` has encoding corruption | Unicode U+2022 bullet characters inserted between every character (`•K•n•o•w•l•e•d•g•e`) | Omit `additionalResponsibility` field; use `technicalRequirement`, `rolesResponsibilities`, and `preferredSkills` instead |
| Capgemini uses `?startrow=N` not path-based pagination | Unlike Nomura (same J2W platform), Capgemini uses query-string pagination | Use `?startrow=25` for page 2, `?startrow=50` for page 3 etc. (25 per page) |
| TCS iBegin: `"C#"` keyword matches all 4,227 India jobs | The `#` symbol breaks the server-side search, causing it to return everything | Use `"dotnet"` and other non-symbol keywords; rely on `require_tech_in_title` for precision |
| TCS iBegin: description endpoint requires POST not GET | `GET /candidate/api/v1/job/desc/{id}` returns 401; `POST` with `{"jobId": <int>}` body works | Strip the J/W suffix from the job ID and cast to int before POSTing |
| TCS iBegin: old domain dead | `ibegin.tcs.com` no longer resolves | Use `ibegin.tcsapps.com` |
| TCS alert links landed on the home page, not the job | Application URL used AngularJS hashbang routing (`/candidate/#!/jobs/{id}`), but the iBegin app has `html5Mode(true)` — path-based routing; hashbang URLs are silently ignored | Use path URLs: `https://ibegin.tcsapps.com/candidate/jobs/{id}` (verified rendering the job + Apply button in Playwright) |
| Infosys alert links showed a 404 page | Application URL used `/jobdetails?...` but the Angular app has no such route — its job-description route is `/jobdesc` | Use `https://career.infosys.com/jobdesc?jobReferenceCode={ref}&sourceId={id}` (verified rendering the job + Apply button in Playwright) |
| Invesco India jobs invisible to `is_india_job()` | Workday tenant IVZ has no country facet and locationsText is "Hyderabad, Telangana" — no "India" substring | Fetcher detects India via city/state token list, appends ", India"; word-boundary guard rejects "Indianapolis"/"Indiana" |
| PayPal/FactSet client-side India check risks "Indianapolis" | Plain `"india" in loc` substring matches "Indianapolis" and "Indiana" | Use regex `\bindia\b` word-boundary match in the fetcher |

## GitHub Actions

- All 50 pipelines run in **parallel** (`& pid=$!` pattern with `wait $pid || fail=1`)
- Firefox Playwright is **cached** via `actions/cache@v4` on `~/.cache/ms-playwright`
- `seen_jobs_*.json` files are committed back after each run with `[skip ci]` to prevent re-triggering
- Workflow is triggered manually (`workflow_dispatch`) — the cron expression in the file is intentionally left as a placeholder
